# CIS 194: Introduction to Haskell (Spring 2013)

In order to learn Haskell I took the [CIS 194: Introduction to Haskell (Spring 2013)
](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13) course.

This repository contains the solutions of each assignment of the course.

Apart from the material of the course, I also checked the following materials:
* [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org)
* [Introduction to Functional Programming - TU Delft - edX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-functional-programming-delftx-fp101x-0)
* [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com)

In addition, since I took the course in an autonomous way, I used some resources to check whether my solutions were correct or not:
* [bschwb cis194-solutions repository](https://github.com/bschwb/cis194-solutions)

Finally, I tried to explain how I solved each exercise of the homework to remember how I came to the final solution. Moreover, it may also help the reader to understand the reasoning behind each solution.
